Let's begin this section by introducing some essential terms in Business Intelligence.

Business Intelligence (BI): Business Intelligence is a technology-driven process for analyzing and presenting data to help businesses make informed decisions. It involves the collection, integration, analysis, and presentation of data to support decision-making within an organization.

Data Warehouse: A data warehouse is a large, centralized repository of data that is specifically designed for the purpose of storing, organizing, and analyzing vast amounts of data from various sources. It is a critical component of business intelligence (BI) and data analytics systems, as it enables organizations to make informed decisions based on historical and current data.
In data warehouse we should consider our data in 4 parameters.
  - Subject Oriented: our data should stored based on subject of our business.
  - Integrated: consolidate data from different sources
  - Time-variant: store historical data, typically over an extended period
  - Non-volatile: do not update or delete our data when it undergoes changes

Data Warehouse Schemas:
  - Star Schema
  - Snowflake Schema
  - Constellation Schema

OLAP VS OLTP:

Dimension:

  types of dimension:
    - Junk Dimension
    - Degenerate Dimension
    - Role-playing Dimension

Fact:

SCD (Slowly Change Dimension):


ETL (Extract Transform Load):
The process of combining data from multiple sources into a large, central repository called a data warehouse. ETL uses a set of business rules to clean and organize raw data and prepare it for storage, data analytics, and machine learning (ML).


FileGroup and DataFile:
Data Files contain data and objects such as tables, indexes, stored procedures, and views.
Data files can be grouped together in filegroups for allocation and administration purposes.
In sql server we cannot access data files directly. We have to work with file groups.

Index:
  - Clustered Index : A Clustered index is a type of index in which table records are physically reordered to match the index.
  - NonClustered Index : A Non-Clustered index is a special type of index in which the logical order of the index does not match the physical stored order of the rows on the disk. Another Index table will be created.
 
If your index is not unique, sql server put a key beside of records to make it unique (so it is better to select a clustered index as unique ourself)

Partitioning:

If we want remove any Data Files we can use this SQL command
ALTER DATABASE PartitioningDB_Test REMOVE FILE Data2002


first value of boundary values, is the maximum value of first partition
if RANGE RIGHT => first value is the minimum value of second partition

If your Table exists do not need to create it. Just set it's Index

If there is a cluster index before, we have to delete them. Then we should create new partitioned clustered index 
Partition Key must be participated in Partition Index.

Here we want to insert some records in our table.

Then by this query we can find out which file group exactly our records stored.
